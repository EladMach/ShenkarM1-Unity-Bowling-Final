Unity Bowling Game - Readme
Welcome to the Unity Bowling Game! Get ready to hit the lanes and experience the thrill of knocking down pins in this fun and engaging bowling simulation developed in Unity.

Gameplay Instructions:
Objective: Your goal is to knock down as many pins as possible in each frame to score points. Aim carefully and time your shots to achieve the highest score.

Bowling Mechanics: To bowl, position your character using the arrow keys or WASD. Press the space bar to initiate the bowling action. As the power meter appears, press the space bar again to determine the strength of your throw. Accuracy and timing are crucial for success.

Scoring: The game follows traditional bowling scoring rules. Knocking down all pins in a frame earns you a strike, while knocking them down in two throws gets you a spare. The score accumulates over 10 frames, and you aim for the highest possible total.

Bonus Points: Earn extra points for strikes and spares, and aim for consecutive strikes (turkey) to boost your score significantly.

Challenges: The lane conditions might change, affecting the path of the ball. Adapt your strategy to accommodate the variations in lane conditions.

Game Over: Complete all 10 frames, and your game will end. Your final score will be displayed along with any achievements you've unlocked.
