All the credit of HDR. goes to him, the EXR.File is only for Demo porpuses . 
And I quote from the post above :



 « You can download them for free and use for private or commercial works, but you can' redsitribute them, share etc.
You need to register to download free hdri maps (just put any personal data if you're going to get only free hdri maps if you don't feel comfortable with this, and uncheck newsletter option if don't want it). 

I hope that you will find my hdris usefull, athough they are only 5.000 x 2.500 (you can get on my website 20.000 x 10.000 if you wish).»
